Topics included:\n\nOverview of approval programs and pathways at the FDA\nEarly endpoints in oncology\nSubgroup analyses and multiplicity\nTime-to-event endpoints and intercurrent events\nBayesian trial designs in oncology\nAdaptive designs and master protocols\nDose optimization trials\nVaccine and cell therapy trials\nRegulatory considerations for real-world evidence and patient reported outcomes\n\nIn the last meeting, we utilized the information we learned throughout the fellowship by forming groups and conducting a mock Oncologics Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) meeting\n\nBiostatistics Intern at Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) in Detroit, MI\n\nI was mentored by Dr. Lance Heilbrun in the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core\nThis was intended to be an in-person summer internship, but was virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While meeting virtually limited my experience, it also made it possible to extend the position. We continued meeting virtually until I started my MS degree at U-M\nI attended a weekly journal club meeting with statisticians and medical fellows at KCI and another weekly biostatistics journal club with statisticians at Henry Ford Health\nI discussed essential statistics concepts for phase 3 clinical trials in one-on-one meetings with Dr. Heilbrun"
