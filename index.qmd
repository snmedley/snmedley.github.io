I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatitics at University of Michigan. I am co-advised by Drs. Kelley Kidwell and Tom Braun, and my disseration focuses on the development of frequentist and Bayesian methods for novel SMART designs incorporating patient treatment preferences. I am expecting to graduate in May 2026 and am currently exploring career options. I would love to continue learning about innovative clinical trial designs and methods!

My complete CV is available, but please see the Research and Experience tabs for a better picture of my current interests and past work!
